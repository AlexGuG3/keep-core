# This workflow initiates Beacon genesis on Testnet. The workflow should be
# manually dispatched after the `keep-core` contracts get deployed and
# kubernetes pods get rotated. The `upstream_build` parameter should contain
# deployment info of at least `keep-core/solidity` module, but inputs
# additionally containing information about other modules will be accepted as well.
