== Background

Keep is a decentralized network that is anchored to one or more host chains via
on-chain smart contracts, allowing interactions both on- and off-chain depending
on the use case. To ensure the safety, security, and integrity of the network,
the network needs to implement authorization, encryption, and authentication. The
decentralized nature of the network brings about the unique challenge where
off-the-shelf protocols (such as TLS) aren't suitable. Specifically, these
protocols can't be used as-is due to their requirement of trusted central
authorities and intermediaries. That being said, with some modifications,
we can make these options more secure and work for our use case.

This document specifies the desired behaviors and properties of a protocol that
will secure the network layer of Keep.

A successful protocol involves verifying identities (to prevent Sybil attacks),
ensuring message integrity (to avoid malicious tampering), and allows for the
encrypting of messages (to ensure that only intended recipients receive a
message). Furthermore, the protocol should be versioned for easy upgrades.

=== Terminology

peer:: A member of a network that can initiate, accept, and handle secure
       connections.
network:: A set of peers who are connected to each other, not necessarily p2p.
chain:: A decentralized, consensus driven store with identities and economic
        incentives.
stake:: The amount of value a given participant has locked up for participation
        in the network. This value is held on the host chain, and always
        associated with an identity.
minimum stake:: The minimum amount of value that is required to be a participant
        in the network.
bootstrap peer:: An authenticated peer that handles requests for joining
          the network from unauthenticated peers. This involves verifying an
          on-chain stake among many other responsibilities.

=== Goal

We aim to authenticate peers, control access to a network where Keepâ€™s protocols
execute, and provide verifiable private channels between communicating peers.

First and foremost, the protocol should be secure.

==== What is a Secure Protocol?

<<AAKE>> introduces us to the definition of a secure protocol; summarized:

1. If two peers, _P~1~_ and _P~2~_, share a secret key it is computationally
infeasible for anyone other than _P~1~_ and _P~2~_, to recover the secret key.
Both peers can unlock the whole communication, but no other peers can understand
the communication unless one of the peers chooses to unlock the communication.

2.  The record of messages shared between _P~1~_ and _P~2~_ to establish the
authentication of identity must be identical, within a given session, regardless
of perspective and logically linked (from one message to the next).

These constraints prevent replay attacks (re-use of previous messages) and
interleaving attacks (injecting a message used in previous runs).

==== Capabilities

In addition to being a secure protocol, the protocol must also provide the
following capabilities:

===== Authentication

The goal of authentication is to provide the communicating parties with some
assurance that they know each others' identities.

An authenticated peer is a known identity in the network such that all messages
from the authenticated peer, _P~i~_, can be provably linked to _P~i~_.

Given an authenticated peer and an unauthenticated peer, the unauthenticated peer
must provide the authenticated peer proof of ownership of an on-chain identity
with an associated stake. If an authenticated peer's stake falls below the
minimum stake for any reason, then an authenticated peer becomes unauthenticated.

===== Authorization

The goal of authorization is to ensure that capabilities within the system are
restricted to authenticated identities.

The only capabilities unauthenticated peers have are sending an initialization
message to bootstrap peers.

Bootstrap peers are authenticated peers that accept connections from
unauthenticated peers and attempt to authenticate those peers.

Authenticated peers can send and accept all kinds of messages.

Further access and capabilities are restricted by the individual protocols.


==== Required Properties

A secure protocol that is capable of authenticating and authorizing peers should
also guarantee **integrity**, **attributability**, and (optionally)
**confidentiality**.

A protocol that enforces **integrity** is one in which data sent over the network
by authenticated peers cannot be modified by adversaries without detection.

**Attributability** enforces that a message from a given peer is known to be from
that peer.

Furthermore, successful attributability requires replay protection (which implies
message ordering enforcement). Consider the following case: an insecure scheme
would allow an adversary to intercept the communications between two peers,
modify the contents of a message (particularly of a message that has already been
received and processed by the receiving peer), and continue forwarding the
communication off to the receiving end. A receiver with an improper
implementation would process this message like any other, believing it was from
the intended sender. This would allow the adversary to forge communications with
a unsuspecting recipient as if they were the sender!

Our protocol optionally provides **confidentiality**, where a message sent
from an authenticated peer is only intelligible to the communicating,
authenticated peers.


=== Scenarios

The protocol should be able to satisfy some known scenarios, described below,
though this should not be considered a comprehensive list.

==== Joining the network

An unauthenticated peer wants to become an authenticated peer in the Keep
Network. This peer must be, first and foremost, successfully staked (otherwise
dishonest participants can't be punished). Furthermore, the peer must prove their
stake to the members of the network.

The _authentication_ and _authorization_ capabilities cover the requirements of
this example. Specifically, _authentication_ allows a peer to validate the
identity of the unknown peer. _Authorization_ enables the following:

1. The restriction of the unknown, untrusted peer to only send the initial
request to be authenticated.
2. The capability of an authenticated peer to respond to on-chain events or to
network-specific events.
3. The disconnection from the network for members who fall below the minimum
stake.

==== Point-to-Point communications

A peer wishes to send a point-to-point message such that only the intended
recipient can inspect and verify the contents of the message.

This example presumes that the identity is verified and accepted in the network,
which means that _authentication_ and _authorization_ are satisfied.
_Confidentiality_ is needed to ensure that the communicating peers can
communicate in secret. _Integrity_ ensures that the message hasn't been tampered
with in transit over the wire. _Attributability_ ensures that if either peer
sends a message which contains a payload that would result in punishment, the
correct peer will be punished.


== Summary

Given the above, we are primarily concerned with authentication and key exchange.
The literature overwhelmingly recommends a solution which provides authentication
and key-exchange considered jointly. Per <<AAKE>>:

> A protocol providing authentication without key exchange is susceptible to an
> enemy who waits until the authentication is complete and then takes over one
> end of the communications line. Such an attack is not precluded by a key
> exchange that is independent of authentication. Key exchange should be linked
> to authentication so that a party has assurances that an exchanged key (which
> might be used to facilitate privacy or integrity and thus keep authenticity
> alive) is in fact shared with the authenticated party, and not an impostor. For
> these reasons, it is essential to keep key exchange in mind in the design and
> analysis of authentication protocols.

== Open Questions

* Is a requirement for communicating participants that they be online?

* Should all communications between Keep nodes be encrypted in order to provide
confidentiality for all transcripts between nodes?
