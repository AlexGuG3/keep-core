= RFC 1: Network Security Implementation

== Background
The goal of this document is to describe implementation details of the Keep 
network security mechanisms, meeting requirements specified in the RFC 1. 

Messages exchanged in the network must be attributable and maintain integrity. 
Messages are also optionally encrypted.

== Types of peers

There are two types of peers in the Keep network: standard peers (referred later 
just as "peers") and bootstrap peers. Bootstrap peers are not trusted any more 
than other peers. One of the goals of having bootstrap peers is that they accept 
a higher probability of DoS. Also, they hide information about network topology 
from parties not being a part of the network what increases anonymity. The only 
type of message bootstrap peer handles is the network join message from peers 
out of the network.
