== Background

Stakers in the Keep network use _work contracts_ to perform work for customers. Work contracts make the off-chain work of stakers available to on-chain applications using a system of rewards and punishments to enforce correct behavior.

Because work contracts must be able to penalize misbehaving stakers by slashing their staked tokens, it is important that they can be upgraded securely. For an upgrade to be considered secure, two things must be achieved:

1. stakers must authorize any contracts that could slash their stakes
2. once authorized, contract code must be immutable

Condition 1 is important to protect stakers against errors and adversaries. Upon staking their tokens, each staker appoints an authorizer who must approve of all contracts that could punish the staker. This ensures that stakes cannot be stolen even if the work contract upgrade scheme is thoroughly compromised, as long as the individual authorizers reject bad work contracts.

Condition 2 is a practical requirement to make condition 1 meaningful. If an authorized contract's code can be changed later, the authorizations provide no protection. This means that contracts can only be upgraded by deploying a new version,
which the stakers then authorize individually.

However, deploying a new contract on every upgrade makes migrating between implementations difficult. Common ways of upgrading contracts, such as the "eternal storage" pattern where the contract holds data in its nominal address while delegating logic to a different, upgradeable contract address, are incompatible with individual upgrade authorization.

=== Current Functionality

The current design for upgrading work contracts is to deploy a new version on every upgrade, and wait for stakers to start operating on it. Older versions would by necessity keep existing in parallel with newer ones, and migrating state between versions is difficult if not impossible. For example, different versions of threshold BLS contracts, even if the changes are as minor as adjusting hardcoded constants, would create entirely separate random beacons. It is possible that the difficulty of migration would lead customers to prefer the old version with established state.

=== Implementation

For each service provided on the Keep network, the components critical for correct incentives are identified and separated from the rest of the service contract as a _operator contract_. Operator contracts aim to be self-contained incentive-wise,
minimizing or eliminating the need for stakers to trust other contracts.

Customer applications use a _service contract_ to perform work. The _service contract_ provides a unified interface to customers, handling the version management of _operator contracts_ and any shared non-critical state between them.

==== Operator contract

The operator contracts handle all operations that may have an impact on staked tokens. Each operator contract is an independent "microservice", keeping its own state on security-critical data. The operator contracts provide simplified functionality that is stripped to the minimum necessary for security and correct incentives.

Each operator contract is associated with one or more service contracts the operator contract provides functionality for. Only these specified service contracts may use the operator contract's interface; operator contracts do not communicate directly with other operator contracts, customer applications, or unassociated service contracts.

When the interface is designed, the service contract must be treated as untrusted and the operator contract must maintain correctness and the safety of the operators' stakes
regardless of the service contract input. Where this cannot be guaranteed, it must be clearly signaled off-chain to operators so they can choose whether to opt in to providing those services.

When an operator contract performs a service, it is paid for the service provided.
The payment is distributed to contributing operators according to the operator contract's own rules.

If one or more participant operators misbehave or fail to perform promised work, the operator contract tells the staking contract to punish the guilty parties and optionally reward a tattletale that proved the misbehavior.

==== Service contract

Service contracts use the basic functionality performed by operator contracts, to provide useful services to customers.

Service contracts receive requests for services from customers, and divide the provided service to operator contract and service contract components. Elements that are critical for security and incentives are delegated to an operator contract, while other parts of the work are performed in the service contract.

Service contracts can usevmultiple different versions of operator contractsvto perform the operator contract functions. The service contract keeps shared state which is not security-critical.

==== Operator contract upgrades

An operator contract is upgraded by deploying a new version, and adding it to the available operator contracts of a service contract. As stakers authorize the new operator contract, the service contract can gradually migrate to use the new operator contract over older versions. Support for obsolete operator contracts can be withdrawn when a sufficiently overwhelming supermajority of stakers has authorized and begun to operate using the new version.

Operator contracts can be upgraded without losing service contract state, but critical state is held within the operator contract and cannot be migrated.

If the operator contract's interface is changed, the service contract should be updated as well. If customer continuity is required, the operator contract can support both versions of the interface.

==== Service contract upgrades

Because operator contracts are designed to be independent of service contract security and correctness, there is much more leeway to upgrade service contracts. Service contracts can be directly upgradeable, e.g. with the eternal storage pattern;
they may be immutable, only accepting new operator contract versions; or they may implement a similar pattern in the direction of customers, unifying core functionality
between immutable public interface contracts.

Because operator contracts can serve multiple service contracts, immutable service contracts can be upgraded by deploying the new service contract version, along with a new operator contract version which can serve both the new and the old service contract. The old service contract can migrate work onto the new operator contract remaining perfectly functional while the new service contract is spun up.

==== Staking contract upgrades

Staking contracts can be upgraded by deploying a new version and waiting for stakers to migrate by withdrawing their stakes on the old contract and staking them again on the new one. Migrating between staking contracts requires waiting the unstaking period and suffering the associated opportunity cost, but staking partial amounts can mitigate the impact as overall network revenue is not expected to change.

Each operator contract needs to identify which staking contracts it accepts. When a new staking contract is deployed, all operator contracts need to be upgraded to a version recognizing the new staking contract, either exclusively or in addition to the old one. When a sufficient amount of time has elapsed and stakers have had the opportunity to migrate, support for the old staking contract can be dropped.

==== Security-critical service contracts

In some situations it may not be possible to contain critical code entirely within the operator contract. If the service contract has to provide trusted input that may impact operators' stakes, the opt-in stake security can be maintained if the service contract is immutable and upgrades are performed by deploying new operator contracts.

In these situations care should be taken to ensure that operator contracts cannot interfere with each other. As a general rule, state shared between different operator contracts should not be used to impact stakes.

If a customer application provides the trusted input, operators should have a method to opt in to only serving those applications they have audited and found acceptable.

=== Limitations

Untrusted service contracts mean that security-critical state must be kept in the operator contract. If the network service has complex security needs, the operator contract may have to implement most of the work logic. If the service contract performs critical logic, its upgrade flexibility is significantly limited.

Security-critical state cannot be migrated between operator contracts; a new operator contract has to start from a blank slate. Inherently long-running operations present a limit to how rapidly the system can be upgraded.

The division of service contracts and operator contracts doesn't map cleanly to situations where the service to applications consists of providing _keeps_, individual smart contracts deployed for individual groups of operators.

=== Example: Random Beacon

The random beacon generates random numbers in response to requests, using BLS threshold signatures on some specific input. The signatures are generated by signing groups that have been created using random sortition from all eligible and active stakers. Rewards and punishments are used to incentivize correct behavior.

To split the random beacon into a service contract-operator contract design, the security-critical elements need to be identified.

In this case the operator contract needs to handle group creation and expiration, BLS signature verification, and incentives.

Handling entry requests and pricing; determining the signing input for generating new entries; calling callbacks; and requesting the creation of new groups are responsibilities that are not critical for beacon integrity from the perspective of the stakers. These can be performed by the service contract without individual staker authorization of upgrades.

==== Operator contract
TODO: Any reason this section is separate from the section named the same above? Can they be combined?
The operator contract for the random beacon provides the following interface to the service contract:

`create_group(payment)`:Create a new group when requested by the service contract,
selecting members using pseudorandom sortition, and performing DKG. The operator contract does not accept input from the service contract, but instead uses its own pseudorandom seed, to ensure that group composition cannot be manipulated. `payment` must exceed a minimum amount and is used to cover gas fees and to reward stakers.

`sign(entry_id, group_input, signing_input, payment)`:Use `group_input` to select a signing group, and generate a valid BLS threshold signature for `signing_input`. Once generated, use `payment` to reward stakers. `payment` must exceed a set minimum value that covers necessary gas fees. When the entry is created, the operator contract calls the service contract with the new entry, using `entry_id` to identify the entry.

Behind this interface,the operator contract tracks its own groups, their members and their threshold public keys. The service contract trusts the operator contract to only provide valid entries when given specific inputs. Alternatively the operator contract could provide the associated public key so the entry can be validated, but even then the operator contract needs to be trusted to provide a public key corresponding to a random valid group.

==== Service contract

The service contract for the random beacon handles customer-facing features and ties the operator contracts together. The interface of the service contract towards the operator contract is:

`group_created(n_groups)`: The call to `create_group()` has finished (successfully or unsuccessfully) and expired groups have been removed. The operator contract now has `n_groups` active.

`entry_created(entry_id, entry)`: The previous call for the operator contract to `sign(entry_id, ...)` completed successfully, resulting in the new `entry`. The service contract keeps a list of operator contracts along with the number of active groups in each.

When receiving a request, the service contract determines what values should be the group selection input and the signing input. The group selection input is used to select an operator contract, weighted by the number of active groups on each, to serve the request.

When the operator contract is determined, the group selection input and signing input are passed to it along with an appropriate payment. When the operator contract returns a valid entry with `entry_created(...)`, the service contract stores it and calls the customer-specified callback.

If a new group should be created, the service contract determines which operator contract should create one (the most recent one, or a random one weighted by recent-ness), and calls `create_group()` on the selected operator contract with an appropriate payment. Once the operator contract has finished DKG and expired old groups,it returns the new number of active groups using `group_created(n_groups)`.

Unlike the operator contract which needs to maintain integrity for arbitrary, malicious inputs, the service contract relies heavily on trusting the operator contracts. This is acceptable because the operator contracts are known, unchangeable code, and the service contract only has access to what customers have paid for entries; boycotting a compromised or malfunctioning service contract and deploying a new one is sufficient to mitigate attacks or errors.
