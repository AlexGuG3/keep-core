== Specification

=== DKG Phase 13

===== Off-chain
Once the result has been determined, all participants evaluate the hash of their preferred result, sign the hash and broadcast the hash and a signature over it
in the group broadcast channel. Each participant collects the signatures matching their preferred result, stores them along with the signers' member indices.

- If the signature of hash broadcasted off-chain is invalid, it will be rejected and not published to the chain in the next phase.

- If multiple signatures from the same member on the same result are found, they will all be filtered-out so that none of them is published to the chain in the next phase.

If multiple signatures from the same member on different results are found, they should all be filtered-out so that none of them is published to the chain in the next phase.

=== DKG Phase 14

===== Off-chain
When a participant becomes eligible to submit the result (with supporting signatures) on-chain they submit if they have at least the honest majority (marked as `H` - constant for the given group size) of signatures for that result (including their own. 

_First player_ is always eligible to submit the result. 

_Second player_ becomes eligible after initial timeout (time necessary to perform DKG protocol plus step time `T_dkg + T_step`) and remains eligible until the result is accepted by the chain. 

In other words, _Nth player_ becomes eligible to submit the result after `T_dkg + (N-1) * T_step` and remains eligible until the result is accepted by
the chain. 

If _first player_ is late and _second player_ tries to submit,
whichever gets mined first wins and subsequent submissions are disregarded
immediately to avoid burdening the loser with excess gas fees.

===== On-chain
When the result is submitted on-chain along with the signatures, the contract
checks that there are at least `H` signatures or more, and that each signature
is valid for the submitted result and the corresponding member ID. Submissions
containing multiple signatures on the same result from the same member are
rejected.

If the above checks pass, the result is considered canonical for the group. All
other group members should abort publishing their results and no new result
submissions will be accepted by the chain.

If the above checks do not pass, the result is rejected.

===== Off-chain
If the result has been rejected and _second player_ became eligible, 
_second player_ can submit its result. Same checks are applied as for 
_first player_. 

If no canonical result has been published until `T_dkg + N * T_step`, where `N`
is the group size, DKG operation is marked as failed.
