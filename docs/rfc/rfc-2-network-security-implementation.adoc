== Proposal
In this document, we describe the implementation details of the Keep network 
security mechanisms meeting requirements specified in 
<<rfc-1-network-security-requirements.adoc#header,RFC 1>>.

=== Goal

Messages exchanged in the network must be attributable, maintain integrity,
and must optionally be confidential.

=== Implementation

==== Network topology and application-level messaging

It is important to understand the difference between the network topology 
and communication between peers on the application level. Peers connect to 
each other based on the rules defined by the underlying P2P network protocol. 
Two peers exchanging messages on the application level do not necessarily 
need to have a direct connection with each other on the network level. It is 
possible that messages exchanged at the application level by two peers are 
relayed by other peers on the network level.

On the network level, we require all peers to prove their identity and minimum 
stake when they establish a connection with each other. All peers monitor the 
on-chain stake of peers they are connected to and are obligated to drop the 
connection with the given peer if that peer's on-chain stake drops below the 
required minimum. This requirement enforces that only peers with a minimum 
stake are able to be a part of the network and this requirement is enforced by 
all peers individually.

Even if a message between two peers was relayed by others, this message still 
needs to fulfil attributability, integrity, and optional confidentiality 
requirements. Since two peers exchanging messages do not necessarily need to 
have a connection on the network level with each other, they also perform an 
identity and stake check before the communication between them happens if such
check is not already performed as a part of the protocol those two peers execute.

==== Peer identification
Each peer is identified by a static public key equal to the delegate key 
associated with an on-chain stake. No two peers in the network are permitted 
to have the same static public key.

==== Network join protocol

Keep publishes a list of recommended bootstrap peers but every other network 
member can enable the bootstrap capability as well. The list contains addresses 
of bootstrap peers and their static public keys. Bootstrap peers are just like 
any other peers, but with the added capability of being able to handle network 
join requests.

The result of joining the network is inherently dependent on the bootstrap 
peer's announced view of the network, that is why choosing a right bootstrap 
peer is so important. Using a malicious bootstrap peer may lead to joining a 
fake network if the malicious bootstrap peer and other fake network members can 
prove the ownership of their on-chain stakes. Using a recommended but hacked 
bootstrap peer may lead to not establishing connections with any other peers in 
the network if the hacked bootstrap peer does not properly announce new peer's 
presence.

A peer wanting to connect to the network sends a network join request to one of 
the bootstrap peers. Each peer wanting to join a network needs to provide a 
proof of ownership of an on-chain identity with an associated stake. As part of 
the network join handshake, the bootstrap peer will also provide proof of its 
own stake.

The procedure is as follows:

1. Peer joining the network initiates the protocol by sending a network join 
   request message containing randomly generated nonce `n_1`, an 8-byte (64-bit) 
   unsigned integer, to the bootstrap peer. The message is signed with the 
   peer's static private key.
2. The bootstrap peer randomly generates nonce `n_2`, which is also an 8-byte 
   unsigned integer, and computes a `challenge` which is the result of calling a 
   cryptographic hash function `hash` on the concatenated bytes of `n1` and `n2` 
   (referenced as `n1 || n2`). The bootstrap peer sends back `challenge,` `n_2` 
   and signs the message with its static private key.
3. The peer joining the network recomputes the challenge from `n_1` and `n_2`; 
   if it matches the challenge sent by the bootstrap peer, it answers with a 
   message containing the challenge. The message is signed with the peer's 
   static private key.
4. The bootstrap peer validates the challenge.

```
JOINING PEER                                      BOOTSTRAP PEER

n_1 = random_nonce()
Message { n_1 } ---->
                                                  n_2 = random_nonce()
                                                  challenge = hash(n_1 || n_2)                                  
                                                  <---- Message { challenge, n_2 }
challenge = hash(n_1 || n_2)
Message {challenge} ---->
```

Message signature is checked for any message that is received. Any message with
an invalid signature immediately aborts the protocol. If all signatures have 
been valid and challenge response was as expected, both parties execute a check 
for an on-chain stake of each other. If the peer joining the network has a 
minimum stake, the bootstrap peer connects the peer to the network and announces 
peer's presence. If the bootstrap peer has a minimum stake, peer joining the 
network decides to connect to the bootstrap peer and becomes a part of the 
network. Nonces and challenge generated during the handshake are discarded. 
Otherwise, when at least one of the parties does not have a minimum stake, the 
protocol is aborted. If the bootstrap peer had a deficient stake, the peer 
joining the network may execute the protocol again with the next bootstrap peer.

==== Network peer authorization protocol

Once a peer has completed the network join protocol successfully, it is 
connected to a bootstrap peer and is a full-fledged network member. It starts 
discovering other peers in the network and connects to some of those according 
to the peer discovery strategy implemented in the network. Before the peer 
decides to connect to any other network member, the same nonce, challenge, and 
stake check protocol must be executed between the peer and the new network 
member it is connecting to. Peers decide to connect to each other only if they 
both complete the protocol successfully and prove their on-chain minimum stakes. 
This is a trust-no-one strategy which allows for even a corrupted network to 
heal in the case of a malicious split brain event.

==== Attributability and integrity of messages

All messages in the network are signed with the sender's private static key. 
Each message is uniquely identified by the sender's address and sequence number 
incremented for each new message sent by that peer. The message identifier is 
a part of the signed message content. Each peer in the network maintains a cache 
of already seen messages for the time no shorter than the longest protocol 
executed in the network. If a message with the given identifier has been already 
seen by the given peer, the message is discarded. This behaviour applies both to 
peers relaying a message and to peer which is the final message receiver.

When a peer receives a message it first checks the signature. If it matches, 
then peer validates uniqueness of the message ID. If a message with the given ID 
was not seen before, then the message is accepted.

All peers in the network have a streaming view of the latest chain state that 
notifies in an event-style when a given address falls below the minimum stake.

If stake drops down below the required minimum for some peer, all connections 
to that peer are dropped and any unprocessed messages from that peer are 
immediately discarded. Once the peer increases its stake so that it is above 
the required minimum, it must initialize its connections with any disconnected 
peers once again in order to be able to communicate with them. In such case, all
unprocessed messages should be sent again.


==== Message Confidentiality

Encryption is implemented on the application level and not on the network level. 
To enable encryption, two parties perform ECDH handshake using standard network 
messages ensuring attributability and integrity as described in the previous 
section. 

Any of the communicating peers can reveal the symmetric key in order to publicly 
publish a complaint about the other peer's message. In such case, the symmetric 
key is considered as compromised and should not be used for further 
communications.

==== Message relay

Two peers communicating on the application level do not necessarily need to 
have a direct network-level connection with each other. It is possible messages 
are relayed by other peers. Each peer relaying the message validates the message 
signature against sender's key. If the signature is not valid, peer rejects the 
message and drops the connection with the peer that relayed that message since 
that peer is the one that tampered the message.

Peer which tampered the message is blacklisted by the peer who received the 
relayed, tampered message. Peer is blacklisted for a certain period of time, 
tracked as an on-chain parameter. This time period is never shorter than the time 
needed to re-transmit the message. During the time peer is blacklisted, all 
connection attempts from that peer to the peer who blacklisted it are rejected.

==== Group formation

In the Keep network, peers may form groups selected to execute various protocols.
The output of the group formation protocol is a list of on-chain addresses. When 
peer joins a group, it broadcasts its public static key which is used by other 
peers in the group to derive the on-chain address of that peer. All the peers in 
the group must execute the handshake protocol described in the 
<<Attributability and integrity of the network messages>> section. If two peers 
executed that protocol before (even as a members of some other group), they  
still use the same nonce and don't have to execute the protocol again.
