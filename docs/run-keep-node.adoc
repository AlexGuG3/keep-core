= Run Keep Node

[#system-considerations]
== System Considerations

The Keep Network expects certain capabilities for each node running on the network.
To help attain these capabilities consider the following criteria:

- It is paramount that Keep nodes remain available to the Keep Network. We strongly encourage a
  stable and redundant internet connection.
- A connection to a production grade self-hosted or third party Ethereum node deployment.
- Persistent and redundant storage that will survive a VM or container rotation, and disk failure.
- Each node running on the network requires a unique Ethereum operator account.
- Each node running on the network requires a unique IP address or a unique
  application port running under the same IP.

=== Recommended Machine Types

Your operating environment will ultimately dictate what machine type to go with.  This is
particularly relevant if you're running a containerized solution where multiple applications
are sharing VM resources.  The below types are sufficient for running at least one instance of the
Keep Node.

== Starting a Client

=== Configuration

The client expects configuration options to be specified in a <<config-file,config file>> 
or passed as <<cli,CLI flags>>. If you specify an option by using a parameter on 
the command line, it will override the value read from the configuration file.

[#ethereum-key]
==== Operator's Ethereum Key File

Ethereum Key File is expected to be encrypted with a password. The password has
to be provided in prompt after the client starts or configured as a `KEEP_ETHEREUM_PASSWORD`
environment variable `KEEP_ETHEREUM_PASSWORD`.

[#ethereum-api]
==== Ethereum API

A Keep Node requires a connection to a WebSocket Ethereum API. You should obtain
a WS API URL from a service provider 
(e.g. link:https://www.alchemy.com/[Alchemy], link:https://www.infura.io/[Infura]) 
or run your own Ethereum node
(e.g. link:https://geth.ethereum.org/[Geth]).

[#cli]
==== CLI Options

[source,bash,role=small]
----
include::./resources/client-start-help[]
----

[#config-file]
==== Config File

Application configuration can be stored in a file and passed to the application
with the `--config` flag. 

Example:
[source,bash]
----
./keep-client --config /path/to/your/config.toml start
----

Configuration files in formats TOML, YAML and JSON are supported.

Sample configuration file:

[source,toml,role=small]
----
include::../configs/config.toml.SAMPLE[]
----

[#storage]
==== Persistance

A client will produce and store data on disk. It is crucial to ensure the data directory 
is persisted and backed on a regular basis. The directory should be provided to
the client under `storage.DataDir` (flag: `--storage.dataDir`) configuration property.

==== Network

Default port mappings.

If you set a different `port` in your configuration, or configure `peers` with
non-default ports configured, firewall rules will need to be adjusted accordingly.

// TODO: Add Metrics and Diagnostics

==== Minimum Required Configuration

The minimum required configuration for the client to start covers setting:

- `KEEP_ETHEREUM_PASSWORD` environment variable (see: <<ethereum-key>> section),
- `ethereum.url` config property (see: <<ethereum-api>> section),
- `ethereum.keyFile` config property (see: <<ethereum-key>> section),
- `storage.dataDir` config property (see: <<storage>> section).


== Build from Source

See our xref:development/README.adoc#build-client[developer docs].

== Docker

== Logging

=== Configuration

Logging can be configured with environment variables.
Please see sample settings:

[source,bash]
----
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
IPFS_LOGGING_FMT=nocolor
GOLOG_FILE=/var/log/keep/keep.log
GOLOG_TRACING_FILE=/var/log/keep/trace.json
----

=== Startup

Below are some of the key things to look out for to make sure you're booted and connected to the
network:

== Testnet

The Keep Network Testnet environment is running against Ethereum GÃ¶rli Testnet.
To run the client connected to the Testnet add `--goerli` flag to the start command.

A Docker image for Testnet is published under:
`us-docker.pkg.dev/keep-test-f3e0/public/keep-client:latest` +
See <<docker-testnet>> section for details.

[#testnet-bootstrap,Testnet Bootstrap Nodes]
=== Bootstrap Nodes

A client running on testnet establishes connection to the following bootstrap nodes:

== Kubernetes

At Keep we run on GCP + Kubernetes. To accommodate the aforementioned <<system-considerations>>
we use the following pattern for each of our environments:

- Regional Kubernetes cluster.
- 10 Keep clients.
- A LoadBalancer Service for each client.
- A StatefulSet for each client.

You can see our Testnet Kubernetes configurations link:../infrastructure/kube/keep-test[here]
