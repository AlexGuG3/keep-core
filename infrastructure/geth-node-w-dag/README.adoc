= Build Geth Node image with prebaked DAG

== WARNING
This produces a very large (1GB) image. You're trading startup time for size.

To build the docker image
```
docker build --pull --squash --no-cache --rm -t $DOCKER_ID_USER/geth-node-w-dag .
```

You can list your new image with this command:
```
docker images | grep geth-node-w-dag
```

Push the image to Docker Hub:
```
docker push $DOCKER_ID_USER/geth-node-w-dag
```
