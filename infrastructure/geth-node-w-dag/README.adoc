= Build Geth Node image with prebaked DAG

== WARNING
This produces a very large (1GB) image. You're trading startup time for size.

To build the docker image
```
docker build --pull --squash --no-cache --rm -t $DOCKER_ID_USER/geth-node-w-dag .
```

You can list your new image with this command:
```
docker images |grep geth-node-w-dag
```

Push the image to Docker Hub:
```
docker push $DOCKER_ID_USER/geth-node-w-dag
```

Start a single node as a Docker container without Kubernetes
mapping the JSON-RPC interface to `localhost:8545`:
```
docker run -it -p 8545:8545 $DOCKER_ID_USER/geth-node-w-dag
```

To connect to the JSON-RPC interface:
```
geth attach http://localhost:8545
```
