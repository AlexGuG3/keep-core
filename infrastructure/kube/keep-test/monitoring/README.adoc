# Monitoring

The monitoring stack has the following components:

1. <<prometheus>>
2. <<grafana>>

## Namespace

Kubernetes monitoring resources are configured in `monitoring` namespace.

To create the namespace execute:

```bash
kubectl create namespace monitoring
```

TIP: To easily switch between namespaces use 
link:https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx[`kubens` command]:
`kubens monitoring`.

## Storage Class

To define a Storage Class used by the Persistent Volume Claims execute:

```bash
kubectl apply -f storage-class.yaml
```

[#prometheus]
## Prometheus

Prometheus is used to collect metrics from the endpoints.

### Cluster Role

To let the Prometheus monitor Kubernetes cluster resources a Cluster Role has to
be created:

```bash
kubectl create -f prometheus-cluster-role.yaml
```

NOTE: This step is necessary only if the Prometheus instance should scrape the
endpoints discovered in the Kubernetes cluster. It may not be necessary for 
the production, where Keep Network Nodes will be discovered with
<<keep-discovered-nodes,Keep Nodes Service Discovery>> tool.

TIP: In case of permissions issues please refer to the <<cluster-role-binding>>
section.

[#cluster-role-binding]
#### Cluster Role Binding

Additional Cluster Role Binding may be required for your user to create
a Cluster Role. It can be done by the Owner in the GCP IAM or by executing a
command:

```bash
ACCOUNT=$(gcloud info --format='value(config.account)')
kubectl create clusterrolebinding owner-cluster-admin-binding \
    --clusterrole cluster-admin \
    --user $ACCOUNT
```

### Config Map

Prometheus configuration files are held in a Config Map that is generated with <<kustomization>> tool.
The files included in the Config Map are:

- link:prometheus/config/config.yaml[`config.yaml`] is a link:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/[Prometheus configuration file],
- link:prometheus/config/external-clients-targets.yaml[`external-clients-targets.yaml`]
is a list of endpoints to monitor (see: <<keep-external-nodes>> section),
- `rules.yaml` is a link:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/#configuring-rules[Prometheus rules configuration] file.

By externalizing Prometheus configuration to a Config Map, there is no need to build Prometheus image whenever it needs configuration amendments. Updating the Config Map
and restarting the Prometheus pod is enough to reconfigure Prometheus.

NOTE: To apply the configuration to the cluster please see <<kustomization-prometheus>>
section.

### Persistent Volume Claim

Prometheus stores data in a Persistent Volume Claim configured in a
link:prometheus/prometheus-pvc.yaml[prometheus-pvc.yaml] file.

NOTE: To apply the configuration to the cluster please see <<kustomization-prometheus>>
section.

### Deployment

Prometheus instance is configured as a Deployment in a 
link:prometheus/prometheus-deployment.yaml[prometheus-deployment.yaml] file.

The configuration uses Config Map resources and Persistent Volume claim described
in the previous sections.

NOTE: To apply the configuration to the cluster please see <<kustomization-prometheus>>
section.

### Service

Prometheus is exposed as a Service configured in
link:prometheus/prometheus-service.yaml[prometheus-service.yaml] file.

NOTE: To apply the configuration to the cluster please see <<kustomization-prometheus>>
section.

The service will be available under http://prometheus.monitoring.svc.cluster.local.

The FQDN was resolved automatically from the service configuration by `kube-dns`:

```yaml
metadata:
  name: prometheus
  namespace: monitoring
...
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 8080
```

NOTE: To access the cluster you may need a VPN connection to the `keep-test` network.

### Keep Nodes Discovery

There are three scrape jobs configured for Prometheus:

[#keep-discovered-nodes]
#### keep-discovered-nodes

The nodes to monitor are discovered with
link:https://github.com/keep-network/prometheus-sd[Prometheus Custom Service Discovery].

[#keep-external-nodes]
#### keep-external-nodes

The nodes to monitor are configured in a fixed: `external-clients-targets.yaml`.

#### keep-internal-nodes

The nodes to monitor are resolved from Kubernetes' services labeled `app=keep`.

[#grafana]
## Grafana

### Config Map


Grafana configuration files are held in Config Maps that are generated with <<kustomization>> tool.

NOTE: To apply the configuration to the cluster please see <<kustomization-grafana>>
section.

#### Config

The files included in the `grafana-config` Config Map are:

- link:grafana/datasources.yaml[`datasources.yaml`] defines a reference to the
Prometheus instance,

- link:grafana/dashboards.yaml[`dashboards.yaml`] defines path to Grafana
Dashboards configuration.

#### Dashboards

The files included in the `grafana-dashboards` Config Map are Grafana
link:grafana/dashboards[`dashboards`] for data presentation.

### Persistent Volume Claim

Grafana stores data in a Persistent Volume Claim configured in a
link:grafana/grafana-pvc.yaml[grafana-pvc.yaml] file.

NOTE: To apply the configuration to the cluster please see <<kustomization-grafana>>
section.

#### Deployment

Grafana instance is configured as a Deployment in a 
link:grafana/grafana-deployment.yaml[grafana-deployment.yaml] file.

The configuration uses Config Map resources and Persistent Volume claim described
in the previous sections.

NOTE: To apply the configuration to the cluster please see <<kustomization-grafana>>
section.

### Service

Grafana is exposed as a Service configured in
link:grafana/grafana-service.yaml[grafana-service.yaml] file.

NOTE: To apply the configuration to the cluster please see <<kustomization-grafana>>
section.

The service will be available under http://grafana.monitoring.svc.cluster.local:3000/.

## Kubernetes

[#kustomization]
### Kustomization

Kubernetes resources configuration uses link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/kustomization[Kustomization] to set common fields and
generate Config Maps.

[#kustomization-prometheus]
#### Prometheus

Configuration is stored in link:./prometheus/kustomization.yaml[prometheus/kustomization.yaml]
file.

To preview generated config run: `kubectl kustomize prometheus/`

To see a configuration diff run: `kubectl diff -k prometheus/`

To apply the configuration run: `kubectl apply -k prometheus/`

[#kustomization-grafana]
#### Grafana

Configuration is stored in link:./grafana/kustomization.yaml[grafana/kustomization.yaml] file.

To preview generated config run `kubectl kustomize grafana/`

To see a configuration diff run: `kubectl diff -k grafana/`

To apply the configuration run `kubectl apply -k grafana/`

## Ingress

Ingress is used to expose the services to the internet. As an Ingress controller
we use Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) built-in and managed Ingress controller 
called link:https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/ingress[GKE Ingress].

Following resources are exposed publicly:

https://monitoring.test.keep.network/grafana

### Configuration

To configure the Ingress following steps have to be executed:

1. Create Static IP for the Monitoring Ingress:
+
```bash
gcloud compute addresses create keep-test-monitoring-ingress --global
```

2. Create a Cloud DNS entry to point to the IP created in the previous step. Follow
the
link:https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/set-up-dns-records-domain-name#create_a_record_to_point_the_domain_to_an_external_ip_address[Google Cloud documentation].

3. Deploy the Ingress configuration:
+
```bash
kubectl apply -f monitoring-ingress.yaml
```

## Resources

This configuration was inspired by this link:https://devopscube.com/setup-prometheus-monitoring-on-kubernetes/[tutorial].
