= Keep Network Private Testnet

We set up a Keep Network Private Testnet that is accessible by the permitted parties.
Here we hold the code helping us to create a bundles for the parties.

The network runs against the link:https://goerli.net/[Ethereum GÃ¶rli Testnet].

The generated bundles contains a preinitialized Ethereum Account details. The account
receives a stake delegation to the Staking Provider Account with authorized `beacon` and
`tbtc` application. This is a production-like experience for the Staking Providers,
where they will receive stakes from their customers.
